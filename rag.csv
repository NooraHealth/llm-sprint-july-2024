TT Vaccination,"If you haven't got shots for tetanus before, you need two during pregnancy. The first one when you're 16-20 weeks pregnant and the second at 20-24 weeks. They should be at least one month apart.

Sometimes, if you had a shot less than a year ago, you might only need one dose. If you missed getting it during pregnancy, you should still get it, even if it's just 7 days before delivery.

They won't give you the shot in the first three months of pregnancy because it could cause problems. So, they wait until after 3 months.

If you got tetanus shots before, you might need one more during pregnancy. This extra shot will keep you protected for 5 years. Better not to take the vaccine every time you're pregnant because it can have some side effects."
Urinary Symptoms during pregnancy,"When you're pregnant, you might find yourself peeing more often or leaking a bit when you laugh or cough. This happens because:

1. Your belly is growing, which puts more pressure on your bladder.
2. The baby inside you is pressing on your bladder, making it hold less pee.




"
Leucorrhoea,"When you're pregnant, you might notice more discharge from your vagina. This is because your body is making extra estrogen. Usually, you don't need any additional treatment unless you have an infection. For any further query, it's okay to talk to your doctor.




"
Leg Cramps,"During the second half of pregnancy, you might experience strong and painful cramps, usually in the calf and leg muscles, especially at night.

This can happen because your body loses important minerals like calcium, sodium, and chloride when you vomit a lot, sweat excessively, or don't get enough salt in your diet.

To help with the pain:

1. Gently massage the tight muscles and stretch them slowly.
2. Taking something called calcium gluconate might also be useful.
If you ever feel unsure or the pain doesn't get better, it's okay to talk to your doctor. They can guide you on what to do during your pregnancy."

In the early weeks of pregnancy, you might feel your breasts getting tender and tingly. As you move into the second month, your breasts will grow larger and might feel lumpy. You might notice delicate veins under your skin, and the area around your nipples (areola) will darken. The nipples themselves will get bigger, darker, and more raised.

Around the third month, you might notice a thick yellowish fluid called colostrum coming from your nipples. It's normal.

In the fifth month, a dark area might appear around the main part of the nipple, and that's called the secondary areola.

All these changes are part of your body getting ready for the baby. If you ever have questions or concerns, it's good to talk to your doctor. They can help you understand what's happening."
Sleep ,"When you're pregnant, it's good to take rest for about 2 hours during the day and sleep for 8 hours at night. Once your belly starts to grow, the best way to sleep is on your left side with your knees bent. This not only feels more comfortable but also helps the blood flow for both you and the baby.

Avoid sleeping on your right side for too long because it might create pressure on your liver. It's okay to sleep on the right side for a little bit. Sleeping on your back isn't the best because it can create pressure on your spine, and it might make your lower back hurt. It can also put more pressure on your heart.

Using pillows to support your belly and back can help you find a good sleeping position and make you more comfortable. If you have any questions about sleeping during pregnancy, just ask your doctor. They can help you sleep better."
Weight Gain,"During pregnancy, it's normal for women to gain about 10-12 kg, and most of this happens in the second (13-28 weeks) and third trimesters (29-40 weeks). On average, you might gain around 350-400 grams per week.
Out of the total weight gain, 6 kg comes from changes in your body (like breast, fat, blood, and uterine tissue), and 5 kg is because of the baby, placenta, and amniotic fluid.
Breaking it down further, out of the 11 kg you gain:
7 kg is water,
3 kg is fat,
and 1 kg is protein.
It's essential to gain weight for a healthy pregnancy, and your doctor will guide you on the right amount for you. If you have any questions, feel free to ask your doctor."
Iron Deficiency Anaemia,"Low iron levels are a common cause of anemia during pregnancy. Usually, you need 10 mg of iron each day, and your body absorbs 1 mg. But during pregnancy, you need more - about 15 mg every day.
Here's what you can do:
1. Eat iron-rich foods. Foods like liver, meat, kidney, eggs, and green vegetables have a lot of iron.
2. Take iron pills and other medicines as per your doctor advises. 
3. Sometimes, your doctor might recommend getting iron through a shot. Follow your doctor's advice for this.

The exact reasons for feeling sick during pregnancy are not known. When these symptoms occur, it's important to explore other possible causes. 

Here are some things you can do to feel better without taking medicine:

1. Know that, in most cases, you'll start feeling better by the end of the first trimester.
2. When getting out of bed in the morning, do it slowly. Keep salted biscuits near your bed and eat some before getting up.
3. Eat small, frequent meals of foods and drinks that don't make you feel sick.
4. Focus on eating, not on what you eat. 
5. It might help if someone else does the cooking at home since cooking smells can make you feel more nauseous.
6. Stop taking iron supplements for now with your doctor's permission. 
7. Keep track of what you eat and drink and how much. Also, keep an eye on how much you pee.
8. Rest more because feeling tired can make the symptoms worse. You might need help with your other children at home.
9. Having ginger can help in reducing nausea and vomiting during pregnancy."
Heartburn,"Sometimes, during pregnancy, you might feel discomfort because the stomach's contents come back up into the lower part of the throat. This happens because the muscles that usually keep things in your stomach relax due to the growing baby pushing on them. In some cases, a part of the stomach can even push up through the muscle that separates the chest and the stomach.

To help with this:

1. Eat the whole meal in smaller portions more often.
2. Try not to bend over too much or lie completely flat.
Take medication as the doctor prescribes. "
